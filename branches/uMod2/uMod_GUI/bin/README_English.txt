Universal Modding Engine uses the D3DX9_43.dll (32bit). Due to the EULA this dll
cannot be delivered together with Universal Modding Engine . If D3DX9_43.dll is not 
installed on your system, Universal Modding Engine will give you a hint at program start.


What can Universal Modding Engine (uMod) V2.0?

-extract and save single textures from a DX9 game (the target texture can be toggled in the game)
-extract and save all textures from a DX9 game (with size and texture format filter)
-load textures into a game to replace target textures
-support single dds texture
-support zip-files as whole mod package (groups of textures can be displayed as tree view)
-support the original TexMod *.tpf files (the tpf support must be enabled through the context menu)

All these options can be switched on or off, while the game is already running!
So you can search for a texture in the game, save it to disk, edit it,
load it into the game, edit it again and load it into the game again, ...,
actiavate or deactivate mods and all without a restart of the game.

side note: If "save all textures" is switched on, the texture will only be saved, if
the textures are loaded by the game and only in the moment they are loaded.
If you switch this option on, while a map is loaded, probably nothing will hapen,
because all textures are loaded for this map. Change the Map or reload it again.

Zip files can include a content.txt" file which contains information about
groups and textures. Two examples are included in the package.

If you load single files, they should match the wildcard "*_hash.dds"


How does Universal Modding Engine interact with the game?

Universal Modding Engine intercept the connection between the game and DirectX.
It is required, that Universal Modding Engine is running before the game is started.

The GUI of Universal Modding Engine act as a server. A game which is successfully
intercepted with the Universal Modding Engine-dll will connect on program start to the server.
The GUI of Universal Modding Engine can handle multiple games at the same time. It will
also process each instance of a game as separate process (if the same game
was started more than once).


How to get Universal Modding Engine work?

There are three ways how Universal Modding Engine can intercept the DirectX connection:
(Do NOT use more than one method simultaneously!)

1) Add the games-binary through the menu "Main->Add game"
    For Steam see below.
    
    known problems: Guild Wars (Win XP)
    
2) Start the game directly through uMod though the menu
    "Main->Start game through uMod" or
    "Main->Start game through uMod (with command line)".
    The game start immediately.

3) Copy the d3d9.dll (from the Universal Modding Engine directory) into the game directory.
    Some games load a dll first from their own directory before they look up the system directory.
    Only for these games this method will work.
    WARNING: never copy this dll into your system directory!!
    
    known problems: Guild Wars

If you have chosen the first or third method, you simply start Universal Modding Engine
and afterwards the game. Do NOT start the game through Universal Modding Engine.

If the game starts and all works fine, a new tab opens immediately in uMod.
In the upper text control you can read the method of injection. An additional information
about created DirectX devices follows e.g. (DX9) or (DX9EX: 3). It informs you, what kind of
device and how many devices were created by the game (and detoured by uMod). If this
information is not displayed, you are not able to modify the game. Possible reason might
be, that the game does not use DirectX9 or uMod was not fast enough to inject the game.

After you have changed Settings you have to update via the context menu (right click
in the bottom window). Update (reload) reloads all texture from disk, this is only for
users, which edit textures. 

Clicking on update will only update the differences (if packages have been
removed from the list, you toggled check marks or changed the order). The reload 
button forces to reload from disk (if you have edited the texture itself).

New mods or textures can be opened through the context menu or through drag&drop
from the explorer. The order of mods can be rearranged also using drag&drop. The order
of mods is important, if two mods try to modify the same game texture. In this case, 
the texture from the mod listed first is taken.

Additionally you can expand mods and activate or deactivate single textures. Mod
with the new mod-format can contain many groups, which can be activated or deactivated
separately. For textures at least one tick mark must be set, for mods and groups bot tick
marks can be unset to give the control to the underlying layer.

How to get Universal Modding Engine work together with Steam?

Universal Modding Engine looks for the name and the path of the executed binary.
Thus you shall not add the steam.exe but rather the game.exe
e.g.: C:\Steam\SteamApps\acoount_name\portal\hl2.exe
If you cannot find the exe, just start the game and use the TaskManager
to search for it. You can figure out the path through right click->properties.
